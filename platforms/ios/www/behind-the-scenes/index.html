      <p>Face Value is a currency conversion app that does things differently: instead of converting arbitrary amounts it shows you the actual denominations in the country you're visiting. It lets you think in your home currency even with a foreign currency in your pocket.</p>

      <p>Face Value was built by <a href="http://lonelyvegan.com" title="http://lonelyvegan.com">Matthew Riley MacPherson</a> and <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com" title="http://triggersandsparks.com">sarah ✈ semark</a>. Both are remote-working, frequent travellers.</p>

      <h2>Why We Built Face Value</h2>

      <p>I saw an app that had a similar functionality while I was travelling in Brazil, but it was lacking polish and, more importantly, Brazilian Reais. Because the app was iOS-only and wasn't backed by open data, it was impossible for me to add the data for Brazil myself. Heck, even if I <em>could've</em> added Brazilian Real data, I still would have had to wait for the app to be approved in the App Store. Instead: I built my own version.</p>

      <p>Outside of Canada and the United States, cash is <em>much</em> more common. You can often use credit cards at fancier places and hotels, but your debit card will not work at point-of-sale. So you go to the ATM and withdrawal a bunch of bills. Then you end up with coins from making change. And you have no idea what any of these coins or notes are worth.</p>

      <p>With Face Value we draw banknotes and coins how they look--does a coin have a silver ring around it like the Canadian Toonie? We'll show you that. And then we say what it's worth in your native currency. I think it's an easier way to deal with foreign currency than doing the exchange rate math in your head. You start to <em>think</em> in Euros slowly, with the help of this app. Eventually, you stop having to look at your phone to figure out what a ten Euro note is worth. I think that's what makes Face Value special.</p>

      <p>Making it open source means people can add a currency in a Pull Request on GitHub and the app can be updated in a few hours instead of days (or weeks). I can't cover every currency myself, but it's the perfect opportunity for crowdsourcing data.</p>

      <p>And it's also pretty, in my opinion.</p>

      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>

      <p>I figured doing the currency calculations would be difficult, but it turns out there are lots of APIs that will let you convert tonnes of currencies. Using Yahoo's Finance API, I make a single JSONP call once every day and store currency's worth, relative to USD. The <a href="https://github.com/tofumatt/face-value/blob/master/www/js/currency-data.js#L20" title="https://github.com/tofumatt/face-value/blob/master/www/js/currency-data.js#L20">code that does it is pretty straightforward</a>; I'm considering abstracting it out into a separate library soon.</p>

      <p>The biggest technical challenge for me was doing lightweight testing of the app and the design; I wanted the app to be bulletproof because I would use it myself while travelling and without a data connection. And I wanted a fun, whimsical design that made you feel more confident when travelling; landing in a foreign country can be intimidating. I liked the idea of the app making you feel like a road warrior who had a bit more grounding than you thought.</p>

      <p>I ended up using casper.js to test the front-end of the app. I ran into some weird race conditions in my testing but ironed them out. I also built tests that were design-focused; currencies can be created via Pull Requests on GitHub, but the tests will fail unless there are all necessary graphics for every currency (including Retina graphics for iOS). I don't see a lot of testing like that in web programming, but I think it's an awesome way to automate some of the more mundane stuff we do in web development.</p>

      <p>The casper tests are quite cool. Rather than explaining them here I encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/tofumatt/face-value/blob/master/www/tests/front-end/" title="https://github.com/tofumatt/face-value/blob/master/www/tests/front-end/">check out the code</a>. They test when and how many elements appear on a page, the contents of text nodes, and even if resources are being loaded. It's very powerful to have the ability to test your JS code in JS without having to add a clunky Java dependency (I'm looking at you, Selenium).</p>

      <h2>Advice for Developers</h2>

      <p>Test your front-end code! Use casper.js to do your testing! I'm using Travis CI because Face Value is open-source, but they have a pro version available too. It's really handy to test on a platform that isn't your computer.</p>

      <p>And keep things simple whenever possible. Face Value <a href="https://github.com/tofumatt/face-value/pull/31" title="https://github.com/tofumatt/face-value/pull/31">doesn't need a server</a>, so you'll notice it exists as an entirely client-side app. One bonus of this approach is that I <a href="https://github.com/tofumatt/face-value/commit/b7127bd6fc44e034b87eacbfdb31f65460ebbb01" title="https://github.com/tofumatt/face-value/commit/b7127bd6fc44e034b87eacbfdb31f65460ebbb01">easily added PhoneGap support</a>.</p>

      <p>And use a grid system and a responsive layout from the start. Making this app work on multiple screen sizes has been a pain, but grid systems make it a <strong>lot</strong> easier.</p>

      <h2>Check it Out (or Contribute!)</h2>

      <p>You can see the app running at <a href="http://facevalueapp.com/">facevalueapp.com</a>. It works offline and can be installed as a web app on iOS, Android, and <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/face-value" title="https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/face-value">Firefox OS via the Firefox Marketplace</a>. There's even a "native" iOS version in the works. You can also <a href="https://github.com/tofumatt/face-value">see the code on GitHub</a>. If you have a currency that's missing, just open a pull request and send it through!</p>
